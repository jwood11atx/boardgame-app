## Reflection

This was a self-direct project project in the 3rd Mod of Turing. I wanted to build an app that I and my friends would actually use. We play a lot of boardgames but don't necessarily keep up with what's come out and have mentioned in the past that an app that recommends boardgames based on what we like would be great. So that's what I made. I've never touched backend programming before so learning to write a backend server was definitely a learning challenge but was a lot of fun. Also, another challenge was the api I used. It didn't have everything I needed so I ended up building a web scraper out of Selenium and built my own database in PostreSQL. Overall, I think it's safe to say that the amount I have learned and grown as a developer is twice as much as any project I've worked on to date.

Tools used: HTML, CSS, Webpack, Babel, ES6, React, Redux, Router, PostgreSQL, Selenium, and Chai & Enzyme for testing.
